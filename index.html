          <h1>From the Desk of the Propietor</h1>
          <p>Since its established in 1998, the Nahadah Group of Schools has been known to excel in both academic and moral endeavors. This can be evidenced by the progressive success experienced by our pupils and students in internal and external examinations, competitions, quizzes, debates, and more. These achievements are made possible by the dedicated and qualified academic and non-academic staff at the school.
            
          The school environment is conducive to learning, with well-designed school buildings, comfortable classrooms for teaching and learning purposes, and laboratories such as Technical Drawing, Language Laboratory, Computer, Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Home Management, and Visual Arts.
            
          Nahadah Group of Schools is a citadel of learning that has wisdom and excellence as its foundation, with the aim of developing the total person in its students with a difference because it is firmly rooted in Allah. </p> 
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="pro-speech2">
          <p> However, with God's grace, Nahadah Schools have persevered and continue to mold students who are prepared to make meaningful contributions to the global society while upholding their faith. Our alumni community has grown significantly over the years, and we have experienced both challenges and triumphs.

          We recognize that it is the Lord's work, and we stand in awe of His marvelous ways. I want to express my gratitude to all the current and prospective parents of Nahadah Schools, and I speak on behalf of our entire staff and management. May God bless you all!

        <h3>WHY YOUR CHILD WILL BENEFIT FROM LEARNING AT THE NAHADAH GROUP OF SCHOOLS</h3>
        <!-- <div class="happy-learn"> -->
          <h2>1) HAPPY LEARNING</h2>
          <p>Our main concern is that your child’s schooling is a happy experience. Happy children are successful and ambitious learners who will achieve their full potential. We have created a welcoming and nurturing environment in which your child will feel safe, respected and confident.

          <h2>2) WE SPECIALISE IN EARLY YEARS AND PRIMARY EDUCATION, PERSONALISED FOR EVERY INDIVIDUAL</h2>
          <p> We only offer early years and primary age education at our school. By doing this, we are experts in the needs of young learners and the approaches required to ensure their success. This depth of expertise will offer a better learning experience for your child. We cater for your child’s individual needs and learning styles and can provide extra support. This may be specialist individual or group support. With such individualised attention, we offer a progressive approach to each child’s learning.
          “[Our son] is always happy before and after school which is a good sign.” Year 2 parent September 2005. </p>

          <h2>3) HIGH PERFORMANCE</h2>
          <p>Students who attend The Regent Primary School achieve high academic results. In 2004, students from The Nahadah Primary School outperformed their international peers but most importantly they were thoroughly prepared for the next stage of their education, wherever in the world that would take place.</p>

          <img src="https://i.ibb.co/RYWbyMX/School-children-wearing-school-uniforms.webp" alt="">

          <h2>4) A TAILORED CURRICULUM</h2>
          <p>As a top quality, British International School, we have chosen to use the National Curriculum for England, one of the world’s most rigorous and well-respected learning programs. The Regent Curriculum adopts a thematic approach to learning which reflects the real world and so makes learning more meaningful and more fun for your child. This exciting and engaging curriculum offers the very best primary education for your child.
            <br><br>
          In Early Years (Playgroup, Nursery and Reception), we follow the British, Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) curriculum, which covers the 7 key areas of learning and development with links to The Nahadah Curriculum. Learning is developed through playing and exploring, being active and through creative and critical thinking which takes place both indoors and outdoors.</p>

          <h2>5) FLUENCY IN ENGLISH AND SUPPORT FOR MOTHER TONGUE</h2>
          <p>We offer a programme of English as an additional language for all ability levels as well as support for a variety of other mother tongue languages including French, German and Spanish.</p>

          <img src="https://i.ibb.co/1RR1QYm/free-sample-1.jpg" alt="">

          <h2>6) DEDICATED INTERNATIONAL TEACHING STAFF</h2>

          <p>All our class teachers and subject specialists are highly trained and qualified. They have been selected for their passion, expertise and commitment to teaching the young. All our teaching staff have received Uk training. Experienced UK educators lead each phase of the school. The Headmaster is an experienced UK educator specialising in Early Years and Primary Education. He has led highly successful schools for over 16 years and has recent experience leading an outstanding international primary school.</p>

          <h2>7) ALL-THROUGH EDUCATION</h2>
          <p>Children from The Nahadah Primary School can transfer to our senior school at The Nahadah Secondary School for their secondary education from age 11+.
